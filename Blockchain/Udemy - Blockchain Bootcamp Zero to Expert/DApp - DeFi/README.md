# DApp - DeFi

In this section we are going to build a complete DApp (DeFi).

## Run dev server local

To run the development server in local, make sure you have the version 16 of **Node.js**.

```js
$ node -v
v16.19.1
```

Then, install all the packages...

```js
$ npm install
```

Finally, start the server...

```js
$ npm start

Compiled successfully!

You can now view undefined in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```
